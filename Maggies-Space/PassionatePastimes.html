            <p id="pchess">For about a year now I have taken a liking to chess. In my free time I love to play chess online and with friends. I even became the secretary of the chess club at LCCC. I enjoy learning new tactics to play and try out on friends. My current ELO is around 1000.</p>

            <p id="ppainting">In my free time I enjoy painting and creating art. The urge to paint comes and goes but when I am in the mood to paint I spend hours working on the canvas. I find it to be very calming and refreshing to paint/create. </p>

              <p id="pcrocheting">For 3 years I have been semi-consitently crocheting. Last year for christmas I made everyone in the family a homemade crocheted item. I find the practice of crocheting to be calming due to its repetative nature but also enjoyable becuase the options as to what I can make are limitless.</p>

              <p id="pinvesting">A new pastime I have come to enjoy is investing. I recently opened a ROTH IRA and have learned a lot about investing since then. I have also become aware as to how world events can affect the stock market and create instablity. I enjoy analyzing the stock graphs(short term and long term) to understand what the best investment for me is at the given time.</p>
