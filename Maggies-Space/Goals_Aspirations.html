      <h3 id="nowedu">Education Now:</h3>
    </br>
      <p id="pnowedu">Currently, I am attending Lehigh Carbon Community College pursuing two associate degrees in Computer Science. I am seeking these degrees because they provide me with a strong foundation of tech knowledge. The skills I am learning through these programs will hopefully benefit me when I enter the tech workforce.</p>
    </br>
      </br>
      </br>
      <h3 id="nowcareer">Career Now:</h3>
    </br>
      <p id="pnowcareer">My current career is serving. I work at Red Robin as a waitress, connecting with customers first-hand and adapting to various day-to-day changes. I enjoy my work as a server because the pattern and order of my duties are repetitive, but no customer is alike. This nature provides me with small challenges I like tackling.</p>

    <div class="column">
      <h3 id="futureedu">Future Education:</h3>
    </br>
      <p id="pfutureedu">In the future, I would like to continue my education journey. I am still undecided as to what exactly I would like to study. A few options I have become fond of are Computer Science, Software Engineering, Mathematics, and or Game Development/Design. I would like to go for my Bachelor's Degree in one of these fields and hopefully complete my Master's one day in Computer Science and or Mathematics.</p>
    </br>
      <h3 id="futurecareer">Future Career:</h3>
    </br>
      <p id="pfuturecareer">My future career(s) will vary. I would love the opportunity to explore various fields and take on differing positions within said fields to be able to witness operations from many points of view. The career paths that intrigue me are Software Engineering, Actuary, Database Management, Project Management, Database Admin, Logistic Analyst and Document Managment Specailist. I believe in these fields I would enjoy a day's work while also being challenged.</p>

          <h5 id="biz">Create my own Business:</h5>
          <p id="pbiz">One dream of mine is to create my own business. Ever since I was young, I have had an entrepreneurial spirit. Whether it was making duck tape wallets or RainbowLoom bracelets, as a kid I was always whipping something up. The concept of having my own business intrigues me because it would fulfil my creative and intellectual needs while also providing a challenge.</p>

          <h5 id="travel">Travel the World:</h5>
          <p id="ptravel">I cannot wait to see the world. For years I have been dreaming of traveling, but due to issues outside of my control, the global pandemic, I was unable to. The places that are first on my list are Italy, France, Netherlands, Japan and Ireland.</p>

      </br>
        
        <div class="column1Row3">
          <h5 id="game">Create my own Video Game:</h5>
          <p id="pgame">Similarly to the business concept, I would love to create my own video game. The idea of writing out a storyline, creating characters, a theme and, developing complementary software sounds incredibly exciting. I like breaking down a project/idea into small, manageable tasks and then putting everything together to create a final product. I believe creating a video game could provide me with that satisfaction.</p>
